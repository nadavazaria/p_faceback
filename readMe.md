# About the project 
    I am trying to make an html page connected to a py script 
    The idea is that the page gets a command from the py code giving it info and variables 
    I want the html page to be able to transmit back to the py script for further use 

## features
    there will be a py script that holds a list of dict's and the dicts themselves will be written inside the html page on the browser 
    the written info will be given to the py app for logging inside the list and further use 
    there will be an option to check if a dict already exists 
    and a page for existing users

### added pages 
    home page 
    login page
    sign up page
    and a page for users accesible only after a successful login or signup

### methods 
    login
    signup - done
    homepage - done 
    for_users - done
